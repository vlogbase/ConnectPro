Context / Goals:

Fix Existing UI/UX Issues:

The “Edit Profile” button currently sends users to a “My Profile” route that returns a 404 error. Make sure the profile page is properly routed (no more 404) and that users can edit their profile details.

There are two sets of tabs:

One at the top: (Home, My Profile, Services, Admin Panel)

Another set below: (Home Feed, My Profile, Services Directory, Admin Panel).
We only need one consistent set of tabs (or a single navigation system). Merge or remove duplicates and ensure all tab links/labels are correct and lead to the correct content or pages.

Implement or Plan Additional Features (the ones not yet ticked):

Personalized onboarding tutorial with interactive tooltips.

Micro-animations for profile navigation (e.g., subtle transitions or hover effects).

Animated profile interaction badges (e.g., badges that appear when a user endorses a skill, connects, or interacts).

Analytics dashboard for instance admins (stats like user growth, posts, engagement).

Quick action floating menu with smooth transitions (possibly a FAB or floating button for common actions).

Custom domain support with SSL configuration (some partial code is there, but we need a final, end-to-end flow).

Advanced moderation tools and content filtering (beyond the basic keyword filter).

Full ActivityPub protocol for enhanced federation (beyond the current simplified version).

Other Enhancements:

Rename or remove any references to “Log in with Replit” so it’s just “Log in” or “ConnectPro” if that hasn’t been fully changed yet.

For the Instances section, add a “Join Instance” button that’s more prominent than “Create New Instance” (most people will join, not create). Allow invite codes or show open servers.

Provide all relevant code changes (frontend and backend) and inline commentary.

Instructions:

Update the routing so that the “Edit Profile” button actually displays a valid profile edit page (no 404).

Unify the navigation to avoid duplicate tabs. Make sure the final navigation only has one set of tabs or one top navbar, containing:

Home (or Home Feed)

My Profile

Services (or Services Directory)

Admin Panel

Implement or scaffold the 8 unticked suggestions from the suggestions list. Provide either code or a plan if the feature is too big for a single pass.

Add the “Join Instance” button & flow for invite codes / open-server listing.

Replace or remove references to “Log in with Replit,” so it’s just “Log in” or “ConnectPro.”

Explain each major change or new file in comments.

Deliverables:

Updated routing & navigation (fix 404, remove duplicate tabs).

Profile editing logic/page.

Join Instance button & flow.

Implement or outline the 8 unticked features.

Updated references to “Log in with Replit” → “Log in” or “ConnectPro.”

Comments in the code explaining what you changed.

Objective:
“Complete all tasks for a consistent user experience, unify the UI, fix the 404 and duplicate tabs, and lay the groundwork for advanced features like full ActivityPub compliance, improved moderation, and onboarding.”
